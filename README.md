# Dicee-Game
It's a dice rolling game. Basically, there are two player, and the dice rolls randomly if any dices value is higher than the other one the higher side will gain 1 point. When the difference between two player reach to 4, the games will end and the higher pointed side will win! HTML - CSS - Javascript are used. I believe functions on JS are clearâ€¦
