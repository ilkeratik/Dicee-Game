# Dicee-Game
It's a dice rolling game. Basically there is two player and the dice rolls randomly if any dices value is higher than other one the higher side will gain 1 point. When the difference between two player reach to 4, the games will end and higher pointed side will win!
HTML - CSS - Javascript are used. I believe functions on JS are clear enough thus you can easily understand by reading it.
